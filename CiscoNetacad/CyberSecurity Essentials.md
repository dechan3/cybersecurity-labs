# **Packet Tracer - Logical and Physical Mode Exploration**

In this activity, I have accomplished the following learning objectives:

 -Investigate Devices in a Wiring Closet
 -Connect End Devices to Networking Devices
 -Install a Backup Router
 -Configure a Hostname

# **Threat domains**

which are areas of control, authority or protection that attackers can exploit to gain access to a system; hence why it is important for an organization to know the vulnerabilities in their threat domains.
Some examples of those vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit :

-Direct access to software or hardware content as well as networks
-Malicious email attachments 
-Less secure elements within a supply chain

**Raising awareness becomes essential between employees to avoid internal and external cyber threats as user domains pose a significant threat to the three essentials of cybersecurity (confidentiality, integrity and availability)**

# **Backdoors and rootkits**

-**Backdoors** such as netbus and back orifice are used to bypass the normal authentification procedures, typically through an authorized user who unknowingly runs a remote admin tool program (RAT) which installs a backdoor for the attacker;
Backdoors grant access to the attacker even if the original breach or vulnerability gets fixed later on

-**Rootkits** are malwares that modify the OS to create a backdoor by taking advantage of software vulnerabilities, which leads to unauthorized system resources making it very hard to detect and require, most of the time, a complete wipe off and reinstallation.
